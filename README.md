Conducted an extensive SQL analysis for Zomato to enhance customer insights and sales performance. Key contributions included calculating total spending per customer, tracking visit frequency, and identifying first purchases and popular items. Developed queries to analyze purchase behavior before and after gold membership, including loyalty points calculation and comparison of points earned within the first year of membership. The project also involved ranking transactions and differentiating member activity from non-members. These insights significantly improved understanding of customer engagement, optimized loyalty programs, and informed targeted marketing strategies.
